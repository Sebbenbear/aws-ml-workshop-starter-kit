The advent of Machine learning is undoubtfully speeding up the medical development, such as new drug discovery and manufacturing, automating the diagnosis through computer vision, personalized treatments and improvements to organization of patients’ health records.

The availability of large amount of clinical data is opening up a lot new opportunities for digital transformation in the healthcare industry. Such as patient management optimization, AI predictive diagnosis and forecasting healthcare trajectories. However, patients’ health records have long been captured and kept as hard copies. In fact, nearly 20% of the doctors still prefer to use paper medical records. Such a phenomenon have greatly affected the pace of digitalization and knowledge sharing, thus limiting the ability to realize the potential from the wealth of medical data. When medical records are digitized, doctors’ notes are often captured in free text and is usually difficult to comprehend and extract meaningful data for analysis.  To address the challenges of digitalization of medical records, we have developed a workshop that will guide you to: 

1) Build an medical document processing pipeline with Amazon Textract and Comprehend Medical 
2) Build, train and deploy a classification machine learning model with medical data extracted from the medical document processing pipeline
