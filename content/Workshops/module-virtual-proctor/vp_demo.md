## Virtual Proctor Demonstration
You should now be looking at a live video of yourself within the Virtual Proctor solution. Follow the steps below to fully exercise the solution before we dive into the technical aspects of the implementation.

2. 	On the right side of your screen you should now see details of any relevant content detected in the scene

> Note: The “Person Recognition” field shows a warning as we have not yet uploaded any face images and names.

3.  Hold up some objects of interest that our virtual proctor is watching for

Oh dear, our examinee has been detected with banned objects!

4.	Duck out of view and watch the results panel

Has our examinee left the room? Better alert the proctor!

5.	If possible, have a friend stand next to you

Our examinee is not alone. Alert the proctor!

6.	Let’s move on to registering our face with the Virtual Proctor. Imagine in this step we are loading the photo from the examinee’s photo ID.

Find a photo of yourself, or use the Virtual Proctor display and your favourite screen capture tool to capture a photo and save it.
> Note: I am a Mac user, so I take screen captures by holding down [Command]+[Control]+[Shift]+[4] together and then selecting the screen region to capture.

Click on the button `Add a new user`

7.	Type your name and select the image of yourself from your hard-drive.
{{< figure src="/images/virtual-proctor/vp_demo/add_new_user_dialog.png" class="img-left" >}}
Click `Add User`

8.  After just a few seconds you should see the success message below:

Click `Close`

9.	Now look at the field “Person Recognition” in the side panel.

10.	(optional) If you are feeling brave, partial or full nudity will trigger the “Unsafe Content” field. Up to you…
