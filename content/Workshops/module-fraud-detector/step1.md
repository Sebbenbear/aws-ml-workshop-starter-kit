## Overview

In this workshop, we provide a video to explain how the Amazon Fraud Detector service works, especially how to tune business rules + ML models to meet your business needs. In addition, we also provide a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom5610/amazon-fraud-detector-workshop/blob/master/account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb) to guide you through the experimental process.

For [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom5610/amazon-fraud-detector-workshop/blob/master/account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb) detail:

* Experiment process:
  * Prepare and map data-sets to Amazon Fraud Detector.
  * Train Models, Author Rules and Deploy Detectors using the Fraud Detector Console.
  * Interpret model performance metrics. (***this is covered in the video***)
  * Define strategies to get the most out of Fraud Detector Models & Rules
  * Call the Detectorâ€™s GetEventPrediction method from a Python Jupyter Notebook  

### 1. Running the notebook

1. Open the 'fraud-workshop' folder and double click on the account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb notebook.

> Open the notebook

2. Please use 'conda_python3' kernel, which is the default one.
3. Run through all the notebook cells to ensure delete resources at the end so that resources won't cost you more after the workshop.

You can now follow the instructions in the notebook to keep going!
