## Overview

In this workshop, we provide a video to explain how the Amazon Fraud Detector service works, especially how to tune business rules + ML models to meet your business needs. In addition, we also provide a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom5610/amazon-fraud-detector-workshop/blob/master/account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb) to guide you through the experimental process.

For [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tom5610/amazon-fraud-detector-workshop/blob/master/account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb) detail:

* Experimental process:
  * Prepare and map datasets to Amazon Fraud Detector.
  * Train Models, author Rules and deploy Detectors using the Fraud Detector Console.
  * Interpret model performance metrics. (***this is covered in the video)
  * Define strategies to get the most out of Fraud Detector Models & Rules
  * Call the Detectorâ€™s GetEventPrediction method from a Python Jupyter Notebook  

### 1. Running the notebook

1. Open the 'fraud-workshop' folder and double click on the account_registration_fraud_detector.ipynb notebook.

> Open the notebook

2. Please use 'conda_python3' kernel, which is the default one.

You can now follow the instructions in the notebook to keep going!
