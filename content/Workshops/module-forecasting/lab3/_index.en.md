In the retail industry, forecasting sales and visitor numbers is an important topic that directly affects your business.
Accurate sales forecasting can help you avoid overstocked merchandise and lost sales opportunities. 
This helps to both reduce costs and increases revenue. Accurately predicting the number of visitors will also enable you to 
efficiently plan employee shifts and provide better customer service.

In this workshop, we will build a forecasting pipeline with Amazon Forecast using Step Functions.
After building the pipeline, we store the retail data in S3, which automatically performs data import, training, 
and forecasting for Amazon Forecast and stores the results in S3. The results can be visualized in Amazon QuickSight, 
but for this workshop, we'll simply graph the results in a notebook.
